# SPA-React

## This Repo is a simple React SPA (Single Page Application) development.

The project involves use of **SASS / SCSS** for styling to maintain the consistency of the styles throughout and to make it easier to style the elements and the children using nesting feature of SASS/SCSS.

```npm install sass --save-dev```

The project also involves use of **React-Bootstrap 5.1.1**.

**Bootstrap** can be very easily installed using Terminal window.

```npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap```

Once the MDB React is installed from terminal window, we need to import the following dependencies in **src/index.js** file :

```
import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css'; 
import 'bootstrap-css-only/css/bootstrap.min.css'; 
import 'mdbreact/dist/css/mdb.css';
```

**Typewriter Effect** is a simple typing animation in ReactJS. We need to install the typewriter-effect package for achieving it.

```npm install --save typewriter-effect```

Once installed, we can import the Typewriter from 'typewriter-effect'
