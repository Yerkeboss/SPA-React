# SPA-React

## This Repo is a simple React SPA (Single Page Application) development.

The project involves use of **SASS / SCSS** for styling to maintain the consistency of the styles throughout and to make it easier to style the elements and the children using nesting feature of SASS/SCSS.

The project also involves use of **Bootstrap 4 & Material Design** for making it easier to use Bootstrap classes for the element.

**Bootstrap 4 & Material Design** can be very easily installed using Terminal window.

```npm install --save mdbreact```

Once the MDB React is installed from terminal window, we need to import the following dependencies in **src/index.js** file :

```
import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css'; 
import 'bootstrap-css-only/css/bootstrap.min.css'; 
import 'mdbreact/dist/css/mdb.css';
```
